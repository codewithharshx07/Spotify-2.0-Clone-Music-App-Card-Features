| [useDebounce.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useDebounce.ts)             | The `useDebounce` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to debounce a value. It takes in a value and an optional delay as parameters and returns a debounced value. The debounced value is updated after the specified delay has passed since the last update of the input value. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to reduce the frequency of updates, such as in search input fields where you may want to wait for the user to finish typing before triggering a search.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [useAuthModal.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useAuthModal.ts)           | The code is an implementation of a custom hook called `useAuthModal`. This hook is used to manage the state of an authentication modal, providing functionalities to control its visibility. The hook creates a Zustand store, which is a state management solution, and returns the store API with three properties: `isOpen` (a boolean indicating whether the modal is open), `onOpen` (a function to open the modal), and `onClose` (a function to close the modal). The hook allows other components to easily manage the authentication modal state.                                                                                                                           |
| [useSubscribeModal.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useSubscribeModal.ts) | The code is a TypeScript module that defines a custom hook called "useSubscribeModal". This hook uses the Zustand library to manage state. It creates a store with an initial state object containing a boolean property "isOpen" and two methods "onOpen" and "onClose". The "onOpen" method sets the "isOpen" property to true, while the "onClose" method sets it to false. The hook returns the store, allowing the calling component to access and update the "isOpen" state as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [useUser.tsx](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useUser.tsx)                   | The code above defines the `useUser` hook and the `MyUserContextProvider` component, which manage user authentication and user information in a React app. The `useUser` hook retrieves the user context from the `UserContext` Context, while the `MyUserContextProvider` component sets up the user context and fetches the user details and subscription information from the Supabase database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [useUploadModal.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useUploadModal.ts)       | The code defines a custom hook called `useUploadModal` that provides state management functionality for an upload modal. It uses the Zustand library to create a store with an `isOpen` boolean value and two functions, `onOpen` and `onClose`, to control the visibility of the modal. The hook returns the store instance and can be used to manage the upload modal state in a React component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [usePlayer.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/usePlayer.ts)                 | The code defines a custom hook called "usePlayer" that utilizes the Zustand library for state management. It provides a store with the following functionalities:-maintaining an array of song IDs-setting the active song ID-setting the song IDs-resetting the state (clearing the song IDs and active ID).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [useLoadImage.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useLoadImage.ts)           | The code in `hooks/useLoadImage.ts` defines a custom hook named `useLoadImage`. This hook takes a `Song` object as an argument and returns a string representing the public URL of the image associated with the song. The hook uses the `useSupabaseClient` hook from the `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` package to access the Supabase client instance. If the `song` argument is not provided, the hook returns `null`. Otherwise, it calls the `getPublicUrl` method of the Supabase client's storage module to retrieve the public URL of the image and returns it.                                                                                                             |
| [useOnPlay.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useOnPlay.ts)                 | The code in `useOnPlay.ts` is a custom React hook that handles the logic for playing a song. It takes an array of songs as an argument and returns a function `onPlay` that is called when a song is played. Inside `onPlay`, it first checks if there is a logged-in user. If not, it opens an authentication modal to prompt the user to log in. If there is a logged-in user, it then checks if the user has a subscription. If not, it opens a modal to prompt the user to subscribe. Finally, it sets the current song ID in the player store and sets the array of song IDs in the player store based on the provided array of songs.The hook is then exported as `useOnPlay`. |
| [useLoadSongUrl.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useLoadSongUrl.ts)       | The code in `hooks/useLoadSongUrl.ts` defines a custom hook called `useLoadSongUrl`. This hook takes a `song` object as a parameter and retrieves the public URL of the song file using the Supabase client. If the `song` object is not provided, it returns an empty string. The hook returns the public URL of the song file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [useGetSongById.ts](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/hooks/useGetSongById.ts)       | The code defines a custom hook called "useGetSongById" that fetches a song by its ID. It uses the React and react-hot-toast libraries. The hook manages the loading state and song data, and relies on the supabaseClient from the useSessionContext hook for communication with a Supabase database. It returns the isLoading state and the fetched song as objects in a useMemo hook for optimization purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [page.tsx](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/app/search/page.tsx) | The code above is a React component for the search page of a music application. It imports the `getSongsByTitle` function, the `Header` component, the `SearchInput` component, and the `Song` interface from different files. The component displays a header with a title and a search input. It then calls the `getSongsByTitle` function to fetch a list of songs based on the search parameters. The fetched songs are passed as props to the `SearchContent` component, which renders the search results. The component is then exported as the default component. |

| [UserProvider.tsx](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/providers/UserProvider.tsx)         | The code in the UserProvider.tsx file is responsible for exporting the UserProvider component, which is used to provide a context for managing user data. It imports the MyUserContextProvider component from the useUser hook and wraps it around the children components, ensuring that the user context is available to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [ToasterProvider.tsx](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/providers/ToasterProvider.tsx)   | The code in `providers/ToasterProvider.tsx` is responsible for exporting a React component called `ToasterProvider`. This component renders a `Toaster` component from the `react-hot-toast` library. The `Toaster` component is used to display toast notifications in the application. It customizes the appearance of the toastr notifications by setting the background color to `#333333` and the text color to `#FFFFFF`. The `ToasterProvider` component is meant to be used as a higher-order component, wrapping other components that need to display toast notifications.                                                                             |
| [SupabaseProvider.tsx](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/providers/SupabaseProvider.tsx) | The code in the file `SupabaseProvider.tsx` exports a React component called `SupabaseProvider`. It imports `useState` and several types and functions from external libraries. The component takes in a prop called `children`, which is a React node. Inside the component, it defines a state variable called `supabaseClient` using the `useState` hook. The initial value of `supabaseClient` is created by calling the `createClientComponentClient` function with some generic type arguments. Finally, the component renders a `SessionContextProvider` component, passing the `supabaseClient` as a prop, and renders the `children` prop as its child. |
| [ModalProvider.tsx](https://github.com/TheoEwzZer/SpotifyClone/blob/main/providers/ModalProvider.tsx)       | The code is a React component named ModalProvider. It imports and renders three modal components-AuthModal, SubscribeModal, and UploadModal. The component takes in an array of products as a prop. It also utilizes the useState and useEffect hooks to handle the mounting of the component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
